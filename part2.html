						<p>"Uninspired authors are placed in the hands of children and youth in our schools as lesson books--books from which they are to be educated. They are kept before the youth, taking up their precious time in studying those things which they can never use... <ins>All unnecessary matter needs to be weeded from the course of study</ins>, and only such studies placed before the student as will be of real value to him."</p>

						<h3>Thomas Jefferson</h3>
						<p>"I am not fully informed of the practices at Harvard, but there is one from which we shall certainly vary, although it has been copied, I believe, by nearly every college and academy in the United States. That is the holding of students all to one prescribed course of reading, and disallowing exclusive application to those branches only which are to qualify them for the particular vocations to which they are destined. We shall, on the contrary, allow them uncontrolled choice in the lectures they shall choose to attend, and shall require elementary qualifications only, and sufficient age."</p>
						<aside class="notes">That was in his declaration of Principles for the University of Virginia</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>Jefferson's plan for an elective course was a blow at one of the fundamental principles of the Papal system which gives the student no choice, and, of course, was opposed by those controlled by the Papal system. Boone says, "In 1814, after numerous defeats and constant opposition from William and Mary College, from Protestant churches, and from most of the political leaders of the time, Mr. Jefferson and his friends sought to provide a university" which recognized the great principle of liberty in education.</p>

						<h3>Review &amp; Herald, Jan. 9, 1894</h3>
						<p>"In our institutions of learning there was to be exerted an influence that would counteract the influence of the world, and give no encouragement to indulgence in appetite, in selfish gratification of the senses, in pride, ambition, love of dress and display, love of praise and flattery, and strife for high rewards and honors as a recompense for good scholarship. All this was to be discouraged in our schools. It would be impossible to avoid these things and yet send them to the public school."</p>

						<h3>Sylvester Graham</h3>
						<p style="font-size: 75%;">"Vegetables and fruit should constitute the substance of every meal, and should be eaten as nearly as may be in their natural state. Bread should be made of unbolted wheat flour (that being the natural condition), though rye and Indian are allowable if unbolted, likewise rice and sago, if plainly cooked. Good cream may be used instead of butter, though milk and honey are somewhat better. Flesh meat and fish in all forms had better be banished from the table. No fat or gravies are to be tasted, nor any liquid foods like soup and broth. Pastry is an abomination, and cakes in which any fat or butter has been used. Bread should be at least twelve hours from the oven, and twenty-four hours are better. And as for condiments, pepper, mustard, oil, vinegar, etc., and stimulants like tea and coffee, they are to be by all means eschewed as deadly foes to health."</p>
