						<p style="font-size: 80%;">The holy pair were not only children under the fatherly care of God but students receiving instruction from the all-wise Creator. They were visited by angels, and were granted communion with their Maker, with no obscuring veil between. They were full of the vigor imparted by the tree of life, and their intellectual power was but little less than that of the angels. The mysteries of the visible universe “the wondrous works of Him which is	perfect in knowledge” afforded them an exhaustless source of instruction and delight. The laws and operations of nature, which have engaged men’s study for six thousand years, were opened to their minds by the infinite Framer and Upholder of all. </p>

							<h3>Jewish Church Schools</h3>
							<p style="font-size: 80%;">"The children were gathered for instruction in the synagogues and schoolhouses, where the teacher, generally the Chazzan, or officer of the synagogue, 'imparted to them the precious knowledge of the law, with constant adaptation to their capacity, with unwearied patience, intense earnestness, strictness tempered by kindness, but, above all, with the highest object of their training ever in view. To keep children from all contact with vice; to train them to gentleness, even when bitterest wrong had been received; to show sin in its repulsiveness, rather than to terrify by its consequences;</p>
						</section>
						<section>
							<h3>Jewish Church Schools</h3>
							<p style="font-size: 80%;">to train to strict truthfulness; to avoid all that might lead to disagreeable or indelicate thoughts; and to do all this without showing partiality, without either undue severity or laxity of discipline, with judicious increase of study and work, with careful attention to thoroughness in acquiring knowledge–all this and more constituted the ideal set before the teacher, and made his office of such high esteem in Israel.'" These teachers took the youth at the most critical period of their development. And how thoroughly they understood the needs of the developing minds!</p><small>&mdash;Hinsdale's<i>Jesus as a Teacher,</i> page 31.</small>
						</section>
						<section>
							<h3>The Schools of the Prophets</h3>
							<p style="font-size: 80%;">Further provision was made for the instruction of the young, by the establishment of the schools of the prophets. If a youth desired to search deeper into the truths of the word of God, and to seek wisdom from above, that he might become a teacher in Israel, these schools were open to him. The schools of the prophets were founded by Samuel, to serve as a barrier against the wide-spread corruption, to provide for the moral and spiritual welfare of the youth, and to promote the future prosperity of the nation by furnishing it with men qualified to act in the fear of God as leaders and counselors.</p>
						</section>
						<section>
							<h3>The Schools of the Prophets</h3>
							<p style="font-size: 80%;">In the accomplishment of this object, Samuel gathered companies of young men who were pious, intelligent, and studious. These were called the sons of the prophets. As they communed with God, and studied his word and his works, wisdom from above was added to their natural endowments. The instructors were men not only well versed in divine truth, but those who had themselves enjoyed communion with God, and had received the special endowment of his Spirit. They enjoyed the respect and confidence of the people, both for learning and for piety.</p> <small>&mdash;Christian Education p.61.1</small>

							<h3>The Fall of Israel</h3>
							<p style="font-size: 80%;">Wherever in Israel God’s plan of education was carried into effect, its results testified of its Author. But in very many households the training appointed by heaven, and the characters thus developed, were alike rare. God’s plan was but partially and imperfectly fulfilled. By unbelief and by disregard of the Lord’s directions, the Israelites surrounded themselves with temptations that few had power to resist. At their settlement in Canaan “they did not destroy the nations, concerning whom the Lord had commanded them: but were mingled among the heathen, and learned their works. And they served their idols: which were a snare unto them.” Their heart was not right with God, “neither were they steadfast in his covenant.</p>
						</section>
						<section>
							<h3>The Fall of Israel</h3>
							<p style="font-size: 80%;">But he, being full of compassion, forgave their iniquity, and destroyed them not; yea, many a time turned he his anger away.... For he remembered that they were but flesh; a wind that passeth away, and cometh not again.” Fathers and mothers in Israel became indifferent to their obligation to God, indifferent to their obligation to their own children. Through unfaithfulness in the home, and idolatrous influences without, many of the Hebrew youth received an education differing widely from that which God had planned for them. They learned the ways of the heathen.</p>
							<small>&mdash;RH October 5, 1911, par. 10 </small>

							<h3>we must be on our guard.</h3>
							<p>The lesson is recorded for our instruction. The enemy of souls will invent may things to lead the minds of our youth from firm faith in God to the idolatrous practises of the world. Let the cautions given to ancient Israel be carefully studied. Satan’s efforts to spoil the thoughts and confuse the judgment are unceasing, and we must be on our guard.</p> <small>&mdash;RH October 5, 1911, par. 11 </small>
						</section>
						<section>
							<h3>we must be on our guard.</h3>
							<p style="font-size: 80%;">We must be careful to maintain our allegiance to God as his peculiar people. While wickedness is increasing in the world, the people of God are to increase in understanding, in sanctified devotion to the cause of God, in keenness of perception to discern between righteousness and unrighteousness. At this time we can not afford to run any risks. If we commit sin, the Lord will be greatly dishonored. But if we work the works of righteousness, we shall follow on to know the Lord more and more perfectly.</p> <small>&mdash;RH October 5, 1911, par. 12 </small>

						<h3>Disire of Ages p. 69.3</h3>
						<p style="font-size: 80%;">In the days of Christ the town or city that did not provide for the religious instruction of the young was regarded as under the curse of God. Yet the teaching had become formal. Tradition had in a great degree supplanted the Scriptures. <b>True education would lead the youth to “seek the Lord,</b> if haply they might feel after Him, and find Him.” Acts 17:27. But the Jewish teachers gave their attention to matters of ceremony. <ins>The mind was crowded with material that was worthless to the learner,</ins> and that would not be recognized in the higher school of the courts above.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Disire of Ages p. 69.3</h3>
						<p style="font-size: 80%;"><i>The experience which is obtained through a personal acceptance of God’s word had no place in the educational system.</i> Absorbed in the round of externals, the students found no quiet hours to spend with God. They did not hear His voice speaking to the heart. In their search after knowledge, they turned away from the Source of wisdom. The great essentials of the service of God were neglected. The principles of the law were obscured. <ins>That which was regarded as superior education was the greatest hindrance to real development.</ins> Under the training of the rabbis the powers of the youth were repressed. Their minds became cramped and narrow.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>The Education of Jesus</h3>
						<p style="font-size: 80%;">The child Jesus did not receive instruction in the synagogue schools. His mother was His first human teacher. From her lips and from the scrolls of the prophets, He learned of heavenly things. The very words which He Himself had spoken to Moses for Israel He was now taught at His mother’s knee. As He advanced from childhood to youth, He did not seek the schools of the rabbis. He needed not the education to be obtained from such sources; for <b>God was His instructor</b>.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>The Education of Jesus</h3>
						<p style="font-size: 80%;">The question asked during the Saviour’s ministry, “How knoweth this man letters, having never learned?” does not indicate that Jesus was unable to read, but merely that He had not received a rabbinical education. John 7:15. Since He gained knowledge as we may do, His intimate acquaintance with the Scriptures shows how diligently His early years were given to the study of God’s word. And spread out before Him was the great library of God’s created works. He who had made all things studied the lessons which His own hand had written in earth and sea and sky.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p style="font-size: 80%;">Apart from the unholy ways of the world, He gathered stores of scientific knowledge from nature. He studied the life of plants and animals, and the life of man. From His earliest years He was possessed of one purpose; He lived to bless others. For this He found resources in nature; new ideas of ways and means flashed into His mind as He studied plant life and animal life. Continually He was seeking to draw from things seen illustrations by which to present the living oracles of God. The parables by which, during His ministry, He loved to teach His lessons of truth show how open His spirit was to the influences of nature, and how He had gathered the spiritual teaching from the surroundings of His daily life.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p style="font-size: 80%;">Every child may gain knowledge as Jesus did. As we try to become acquainted with our heavenly Father through His word, angels will draw near, our minds will be strengthened, our characters will be elevated and refined. We shall become more like our Saviour. And as we behold the beautiful and grand in nature, our affections go out after God. While the spirit is awed, the soul is invigorated by coming in contact with the Infinite through His works. Communion with God through prayer develops the mental and moral faculties, and the spiritual powers strengthen as we cultivate thoughts upon spiritual things.</p>

						<h3>Christ's Object Lessons p. 114.2</h3>
						<p style="font-size: 80%;">In His prayer to the Father, Christ gave to the world a lesson which should be graven on mind and soul. “This is life eternal,” He said, “that they might know Thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom Thou hast sent.” John 17:3. This is true education. It imparts power. The experimental knowledge of God and of Jesus Christ whom He has sent, transforms man into the image of God. It gives to man the mastery of himself, bringing every impulse and passion of the lower nature under the control of the higher powers of the mind. It makes its possessor a son of God and an heir of heaven. It brings him into communion with the mind of the Infinite, and opens to him the rich treasures of the universe.</p>

						<h3>Steps to Christ p.9</h3>
						<p style="font-size: 80%;">Nature and revelation alike testify of God’s love. Our Father in heaven is the source of life, of wisdom, and of joy. Look at the wonderful and beautiful things of nature. Think of their marvelous adaptation to the needs and happiness, not only of man, but of all living creatures. The sunshine and the rain, that gladden and refresh the earth, the hills and seas and plains, all speak to us of the Creator’s love. It is God who supplies the daily needs of all His creatures.

						<h3>Steps to Christ p.78.1</h3>
						<p style="font-size: 80%;">The Saviour’s life on earth was not a life of ease and devotion to Himself, but He toiled with persistent, earnest, untiring effort for the salvation of lost mankind. From the manger to Calvary He followed the path of self-denial and sought not to be released from arduous tasks, painful travels and exhausting care and labor. He said, “<ins>The Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give His life a ransom for many.</ins>” Matthew 20:28. <b>This was the one great object of His life. Everything else was secondary and subservient.</b> It was His meat and drink to do the will of God and to finish His work. Self and self-interest had no part in His labor.</p>
