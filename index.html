							<h3>Jewish Church Schools</h3>
							<p style="font-size: 80%;">"The children were gathered for instruction in the synagogues and schoolhouses, where the teacher, generally the Chazzan, or officer of the synagogue, imparted to them the precious knowledge of the law, with constant adaptation to their capacity, with unwearied patience, intense earnestness, strictness tempered by kindness, but, above all, with the highest object of their training ever in view. To keep children from all contact with vice; to train them to gentleness, even when bitterest wrong had been received; to show sin in its repulsiveness, rather than to terrify by its consequences;</p>
						</section>
						<section>
							<p style="font-size: 80%;">to train to strict truthfulness; to avoid all that might lead to disagreeable or indelicate thoughts; and to do all this without showing partiality, without either undue severity or laxity of discipline, with judicious increase of study and work, with careful attention to thoroughness in acquiring knowledge–all this and more constituted the ideal set before the teacher, and made his office of such high esteem in Israel.." These teachers took the youth at the most critical period of their development. And how thoroughly they understood the needs of the developing minds!</p><small>&mdash;Hinsdale's <i>Jesus as a Teacher,</i> page 31.</small>
						</section>
						<section>
							<h3>The Schools of the Prophets</h3>
							<p style="font-size: 80%;">Further provision was made for the instruction of the young, by the establishment of the schools of the prophets. If a youth desired to search deeper into the truths of the word of God, and to seek wisdom from above, that he might become a teacher in Israel, these schools were open to him. The schools of the prophets were founded by Samuel, to serve as a barrier against the wide-spread corruption, to provide for the moral and spiritual welfare of the youth, and to promote the future prosperity of the nation by furnishing it with men qualified to act in the fear of God as leaders and counselors.</p>
						</section>
						<section>
							<p style="font-size: 80%;">In the accomplishment of this object, Samuel gathered companies of young men who were pious, intelligent, and studious. These were called the sons of the prophets. As they communed with God, and studied his word and his works, wisdom from above was added to their natural endowments. The instructors were men not only well versed in divine truth, but those who had themselves enjoyed communion with God, and had received the special endowment of his Spirit. They enjoyed the respect and confidence of the people, both for learning and for piety.</p> <small>&mdash;Christian Education p.61.1</small>

						<section>
							<h3>The Fall of Israel</h3>
							<p style="font-size: 80%;">Wherever in Israel God’s plan of education was carried into effect, its results testified of its Author. But in very many households the training appointed by heaven, and the characters thus developed, were alike rare. God’s plan was but partially and imperfectly fulfilled. By unbelief and by disregard of the Lord’s directions, the Israelites surrounded themselves with temptations that few had power to resist. At their settlement in Canaan “they did not destroy the nations, concerning whom the Lord had commanded them: but were mingled among the heathen, and learned their works. And they served their idols: which were a snare unto them.” Their heart was not right with God, “neither were they steadfast in his covenant.</p>
						</section>
						<section>
							<p style="font-size: 80%;">But he, being full of compassion, forgave their iniquity, and destroyed them not; yea, many a time turned he his anger away.... For he remembered that they were but flesh; a wind that passeth away, and cometh not again.” Fathers and mothers in Israel became indifferent to their obligation to God, indifferent to their obligation to their own children. Through unfaithfulness in the home, and idolatrous influences without, many of the Hebrew youth received an education differing widely from that which God had planned for them. They learned the ways of the heathen.</p>
							<small>&mdash;RH October 5, 1911, par. 10 </small>
						</section>
						<section>
							<h3>we must be on our guard.</h3>
							<p>The lesson is recorded for our instruction. The enemy of souls will invent may things to lead the minds of our youth from firm faith in God to the idolatrous practices of the world. Let the cautions given to ancient Israel be carefully studied. Satan’s efforts to spoil the thoughts and confuse the judgment are unceasing, and we must be on our guard.</p>
						</section>
						<section>
							<p style="font-size: 80%;">We must be careful to maintain our allegiance to God as his peculiar people. While wickedness is increasing in the world, the people of God are to increase in understanding, in sanctified devotion to the cause of God, in keenness of perception to discern between righteousness and unrighteousness. At this time we can not afford to run any risks. If we commit sin, the Lord will be greatly dishonored. But if we work the works of righteousness, we shall follow on to know the Lord more and more perfectly.</p> <small>&mdash;RH October 5, 1911, par. 12 </small>

						<h3>Desire of Ages p. 69.3</h3>
						<p style="font-size: 80%;">In the days of Christ the town or city that did not provide for the religious instruction of the young was regarded as under the curse of God. Yet the teaching had become formal. Tradition had in a great degree supplanted the Scriptures. <b>True education would lead the youth to “seek the Lord,</b> if haply they might feel after Him, and find Him.” Acts 17:27. But the Jewish teachers gave their attention to matters of ceremony. <ins>The mind was crowded with material that was worthless to the learner,</ins> and that would not be recognized in the higher school of the courts above.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p style="font-size: 80%;"><i>The experience which is obtained through a personal acceptance of God’s word had no place in the educational system.</i> Absorbed in the round of externals, the students found no quiet hours to spend with God. They did not hear His voice speaking to the heart. In their search after knowledge, they turned away from the Source of wisdom. The great essentials of the service of God were neglected. The principles of the law were obscured. <ins>That which was regarded as superior education was the greatest hindrance to real development.</ins> Under the training of the rabbis the powers of the youth were repressed. Their minds became cramped and narrow.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>The Education of Jesus</h3>
						<p style="font-size: 80%;">The child Jesus did not receive instruction in the synagogue schools. His mother was His first human teacher. From her lips and from the scrolls of the prophets, He learned of heavenly things. The very words which He Himself had spoken to Moses for Israel He was now taught at His mother’s knee. As He advanced from childhood to youth, He did not seek the schools of the rabbis. He needed not the education to be obtained from such sources; for <b>God was His instructor</b>.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p style="font-size: 80%;">The question asked during the Saviour’s ministry, “How knoweth this man letters, having never learned?” does not indicate that Jesus was unable to read, but merely that He had not received a rabbinical education. John 7:15. Since He gained knowledge as we may do, His intimate acquaintance with the Scriptures shows how diligently His early years were given to the study of God’s word. And spread out before Him was the great library of God’s created works. He who had made all things studied the lessons which His own hand had written in earth and sea and sky.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p style="font-size: 80%;">Apart from the unholy ways of the world, He gathered stores of scientific knowledge from nature. He studied the life of plants and animals, and the life of man. From His earliest years He was possessed of one purpose; He lived to bless others. For this He found resources in nature; new ideas of ways and means flashed into His mind as He studied plant life and animal life. Continually He was seeking to draw from things seen illustrations by which to present the living oracles of God. The parables by which, during His ministry, He loved to teach His lessons of truth show how open His spirit was to the influences of nature, and how He had gathered the spiritual teaching from the surroundings of His daily life.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p style="font-size: 80%;"><ins>Every child may gain knowledge as Jesus did.</ins> As we try to become acquainted with our heavenly Father through His word, angels will draw near, our minds will be strengthened, our characters will be elevated and refined. We shall become more like our Saviour. And as we behold the beautiful and grand in nature, our affections go out after God. While the spirit is awed, the soul is invigorated by coming in contact with the Infinite through His works. Communion with God through prayer develops the mental and moral faculties, and the spiritual powers strengthen as we cultivate thoughts upon spiritual things.</p>

						<h3>Christ's Object Lessons p. 114.2</h3>
						<p style="font-size: 80%;">In His prayer to the Father, Christ gave to the world a lesson which should be graven on mind and soul. “This is life eternal,” He said, “that they might know Thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom Thou hast sent.” John 17:3. This is true education. It imparts power. The experimental knowledge of God and of Jesus Christ whom He has sent, transforms man into the image of God. It gives to man the mastery of himself, bringing every impulse and passion of the lower nature under the control of the higher powers of the mind. It makes its possessor a son of God and an heir of heaven. It brings him into communion with the mind of the Infinite, and opens to him the rich treasures of the universe.</p>

						<p style="font-size: 80%;">Nature and revelation alike testify of God’s love. Our Father in heaven is the source of life, of wisdom, and of joy. Look at the wonderful and beautiful things of nature. Think of their marvelous adaptation to the needs and happiness, not only of man, but of all living creatures. The sunshine and the rain, that gladden and refresh the earth, the hills and seas and plains, all speak to us of the Creator’s love. It is God who supplies the daily needs of all His creatures.

						<h3>Steps to Christ p.78.1</h3>
						<p style="font-size: 80%;">The Saviour’s life on earth was not a life of ease and devotion to Himself, but He toiled with persistent, earnest, untiring effort for the salvation of lost mankind. From the manger to Calvary He followed the path of self-denial and sought not to be released from arduous tasks, painful travels and exhausting care and labor. He said, “<ins>The Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give His life a ransom for many.</ins>” Matthew 20:28. <b>This was the one great object of His life. Everything else was secondary and subservient.</b> It was His meat and drink to do the will of God and to finish His work. Self and self-interest had no part in His labor.</p>

						<h3>Creeping Compromise</h3>
						<p style="font-size: 75%;">The apostle Paul, in his second letter to the Thessalonians, foretold the great apostasy which would result in the establishment of the papal power. He declared that the day of Christ should not come, “except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition; who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshiped; so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God, showing himself that he is God.” [2 Thessalonians 2:3, 4, 7.] And furthermore, the apostle warns his brethren that “the mystery of iniquity doth already work.” [2 Thessalonians 2:3, 4, 7.] Even at that early date he saw, creeping into the church, errors that would prepare the way for the development of the papacy.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p style="font-size: 75%;">Little by little, at first in stealth and silence, and then more openly as it increased in strength and gained control of the minds of men, the mystery of iniquity carried forward its deceptive and blasphemous work. Almost imperceptibly the customs of heathenism found their way into the Christian church. The spirit of compromise and conformity was restrained for a time by the fierce persecutions which the church endured under paganism. But as persecution ceased, and Christianity entered the courts and palaces of kings, she laid aside the humble simplicity of Christ and his apostles for the pomp and pride of pagan priests and rulers; and in place of the requirements of God, she substituted human theories and traditions.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>This compromise between paganism and Christianity resulted in the development of the “man of sin” foretold in prophecy as opposing and exalting himself above God. That gigantic system of false religion is a masterpiece of Satan’s power,—<ins>a monument of his efforts to seat himself upon the throne to rule the earth according to his will.</ins></p>

						<p>"In most of the schools, the so-called seven liberal arts were taught. The pupil commenced with grammar, then proceeded to rhetoric, and afterward to logic or dialectics.

					</section>
					<section>
						<p style="font-size: 80%;">"Seven years were devoted to the completion of the course in liberal arts (the Trivium and the Quadrivium) Dialectic or logic was based somewhat remotely on the writings of Aristotle. At a later period, logic was rigidly applied to the development of theology, and gave rise to a class of scholars called the school- men. . . . . Arithmetic was imperfectly taught, importance being attached to the supposed secret properties of numbers. Geometry was taught in an abridged form, while astronomy did not differ materially from astrology. The study of music consisted chiefly in learning to chant the hymns of the church."</p>

						<h3>Thomas Jefferson</h3>
						<p>"I am not fully informed of the practices at Harvard, but there is one from which we shall certainly vary, although it has been copied, I believe, by nearly every college and academy in the United States. That is the holding of students all to one prescribed course of reading, and disallowing exclusive application to those branches only which are to qualify them for the particular vocations to which they are destined. We shall, on the contrary, allow them uncontrolled choice in the lectures they shall choose to attend, and shall require elementary qualifications only, and sufficient age."</p>
						<aside class="notes">That was in his declaration of Principles for the University of Virginia</aside>

						<p>Jefferson's plan for an elective course was a blow at one of the fundamental principles of the Papal system which gives the student no choice, and, of course, was opposed by those controlled by the Papal system. Boone says, "In 1814, after numerous defeats and constant opposition from William and Mary College, from Protestant churches, and from most of the political leaders of the time, Mr. Jefferson and his friends sought to provide a university" which recognized the great principle of liberty in education.</p>

						<h3>Review &amp; Herald, Jan. 9, 1894</h3>
						<p>"In our institutions of learning there was to be exerted an influence that would counteract the influence of the world, and give no encouragement to indulgence in appetite, in selfish gratification of the senses, in pride, ambition, love of dress and display, love of praise and flattery, and strife for high rewards and honors as a recompense for good scholarship. All this was to be discouraged in our schools. It would be impossible to avoid these things and yet send them to the public school."</p>

						<h3>Sylvester Graham</h3>
						<p style="font-size: 75%;">"Vegetables and fruit should constitute the substance of every meal, and should be eaten as nearly as may be in their natural state. Bread should be made of unbolted wheat flour (that being the natural condition), though rye and Indian are allowable if unbolted, likewise rice and sago, if plainly cooked. Good cream may be used instead of butter, though milk and honey are somewhat better. Flesh meat and fish in all forms had better be banished from the table. No fat or gravies are to be tasted, nor any liquid foods like soup and broth. Pastry is an abomination, and cakes in which any fat or butter has been used. Bread should be at least twelve hours from the oven, and twenty-four hours are better. And as for condiments, pepper, mustard, oil, vinegar, etc., and stimulants like tea and coffee, they are to be by all means eschewed as deadly foes to health."</p>

						<h3>THOMAS JEFFERSON</h3>
						<p>"Instead of constructing a single and large edifice which might have exhausted their funds, and left nothing or too little for other essential expenses, they thought it better to erect a small and separate building for each professor with an apartment for his lectures, and others for their own accommodations, connecting these cottages, by a range of dormitories capable each of lodging two students only--a provision equally friendly to study as to morals and order." Of the student&apos;s cottages it is said, "They consisted of one story dormitories exhibiting a not unpleasant effect,"</p>

						<h3>The University of Virginia</h3>
						<p style="font-size: 80%;">The students were divided into small companies of eight or ten each, and each company placed under the supervision of one of the older students... It broke the monotony of ordinary student life; it promoted health and buoyancy of spirit; in the hours of field and forest labor, there was found. not only relief from study but such a variety of incident, that the students of those days found more means of solid enjoyment than others have since... All the students except day students boarded in a common hall, where by practicing economy and with the help of the farm, a variable surplus was realized each year which was applied in making improvements."</p>

						<h3>Sports</h3>
						<p>The time employed in physical exercise, which step leads on to excess, to intensity in the games, and the exercise of the faculties, ought to be used in Christ's lines, and the blessing of God will rest upon them in so doing... Diligent study is essential. The influence has been growing among students in their devotion to amusement, to a fascinating, bewitching power, to the counteracting of the influence of the truth upon the human mind and character... What force of powers is put into your games of football and your other inventions after the way of the Gentile -- exercises that bless no one... I cannot find an instance in the life of Christ where he devoted time to play and amusement."</p><small>&mdash;Testimonies on Education pp. 190-192</small>

						<p>Individuality, originality, and independence of thought and action on the part of the student are in the end destroyed by the Papal system of education and other systems derived from it. This system is intended by its promoters to destroy these vital elements of character in order to make the individual a willing, blind, obedient servant to the mandates Of men. The Papacy can not prosper except as it does destroy these most godlike faculties of man.</p>
						<aside class="notes">Why is it important that individuality is encouraged? <br>The church is the body of Christ, and there are many different parts of the body, if our education make as all alike, then how are we going to be able to perform the tasks that God created us individually to do</aside>

						<h3>The Light Rejected</h3>
						<p>Jefferson's school finally lost out in its reforms because he was unwise enough to select a number of members for the faculty of the University of Virginia from the universities of Europe. Wise as was Jefferson on many great questions, he was weak on this point.</p>
